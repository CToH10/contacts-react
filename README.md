This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and built in TypeScript.

## Before installing

This app consumes [this](https://github.com/CToH10/contacts) API, so before trying this one out, make sure you have the proper connection.

### If you don't want to install

You can try the application [here](https://contacts-react-nine.vercel.app/home), but make sure the [API](https://github.com/CToH10/contacts) is running on port 3000.

## Installation

In the project directory, you can run:

### `pnpm install`

To install all libraries used in the project.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `pnpm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open your local host to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `pnpm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
The app is ready to be deployed!

See the react official section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `pnpm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Point of attention

To properly consume API, make sure you have the adequate URL setup in your enviroment, according to the example.
